# PALIMPSEST is a text manipulation toolkit and live editor

-----------------------------------------
## basic concepts

any piece of text (referred to as a string) can have a number of methods applied to it.

every change you make to the text and each method applied to it will update on the opposite side of the screen.

you can also execute the code by typing
`(windows, linux) ctrl-enter`
    or
`(mac) cmd-enter`

```
"PALIMPSEST is a text manipulation toolkit"
    .scramble(true).out();

"it allows you to send text through a number of processes, which are defined at the bottom of this page".out();
```

-----------------------------------------
### chaining

any command can be chained together and will only be output if ended with out().

these chains can span multiple lines,making the document easier to read and experiment with.

```
"any method can be chained".out()

"any method can be chained"
    .decimate(0.5)
    .reverse(true)
    .out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### text buffers 

this tool can also handle text documents by selecting from numbers 0-9 in the middle toolbar.

each text buffer exists in an array, accessible as 
    `txt[index of file]`

below, the first text buffer (numbers starting at zero) is reversed.
    `txt[0].reverse()`
    
you can also upload multiple files using the chooser at the top of the page.
(note: your existing buffers will be
overwritten)


-----------------------------------------
### selector

after loading your files you can view them individually by clicking on the numbers that appear in the middle of the page.

the text can be retrieved using this number

```
"you can upload multiple text files using the button at the top of the page (and shift-click-ing on each)".out()

"then you can view them individually using the selector in the middle".out()

"and use them in your code by accessing the txt array. the first file would be accessed as txt[0], as arrays begin at zero.".out()
```

## METHODS

* text manipulation
    * [decimate (amount, substitute = '-')](#decimate)
    * [filterRepeat (invert = false)](#filterRepeat)
    * [superimpose (txt2, delineate = ' ')](#superimpose)
    * [interleave (txt2, amount = 1.0, words = false)](#interleave)
    * [reverse (words = true)](#reverse)
    * [scramble (words = true)](#scramble)
* other
    * [random (arr = txt)](#random)
    * [out ()](#out)

-----------------------------------------
### decimate
##### *decimate (amount, substitute = '-')*

you can decimate a string, replacing a percentage of the text with the  substitution.

by default it decimates individual characters, but soon it will allow for decimating words instead.

```
"let your text decay".decimate(0.2, '-').out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### filterRepeat
##### *filterRepeat (invert = false)*

you can filter out all repeat occurrences of words.

this function can also be inverted so that only the repeats will be displayed.

```
"only the first occurrence of the word will appear".filterRepeat().out()

"when inverted, only the repeated words will appear".filterRepeat(true).out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### superimpose
##### *superimpose (txt2, delineate = ' ')*

superimpose will replace all non-whitespace characters of the first document with the second.

```
"lay two texts on top of each other".superimpose("THE TEXT ON TOP").out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### interleave
##### *interleave (txt2, amount = 1.0, words = false)*

interleave will output a string that alternates the characters(or words) between two texts. If a second argument is provided, it will alternate between the texts at the given percentage.

```
"you can perform text weaving"
    .interleave("to get interesting combinations of material", 1.0, true)
    .out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### reverse
##### *reverse (words = true)*

reverse will reverse the order of the words in a string.

by passing false as an argument, it will reverse individual characters instead.

```
"you can read forward or backwards".reverse().out()
"you can read forward or backwards".reverse(true).out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### scramble
##### *scramble (words = true)*

scramble will mix up all of the words or individual characters of a string.

```
"some text is better scrambled".reverse().out()
"some text is better scrambled".reverse(true).out()
```

-----------------------------------------
### random
##### *random (arr = txt)*

the random command can be used to select a random element from an array.

this means you can select texts at random
    random(txt).decimate(0.2)

or use it to generate a random number
    txt[0].decimate(random([0.0,0.5]))

if no arguments are passed, it will get the txt array by default.

```
random(
    [
        "anything can be passed as an array",
        "it can work on text and on numbers".decimate(random([0.1,0.8]))
    ]
).out();

/* for example
random(txt)
    .reverse(true)
    .interleave(random(txt), , true)
    .out()
*/
```
