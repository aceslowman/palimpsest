    PALIMPSEST is a text manipulation toolkit


    basic concepts
    -----------------------------------------
    any piece of text (referred to as a 
    string) can have a number of methods 
    applied to it.

    every change you make to the text and
    each method applied to it will update
    on the opposite side of the screen.

    you can also execute the code by typing
    (windows, linux) ctrl-enter
        or
    (mac) cmd-enter

/*

    chaining
    -----------------------------------------
    any command can be chained together and 
    will only be output if ended with out().

    these chains can span multiple lines,
    making the document easier to read and
    experiment with.

/*  

    text buffers 
    -----------------------------------------
    this tool can also handle text documents 
    by selecting from numbers 0-9 in the 
    middle toolbar.
    
    each text buffer exists in an array, 
    accessible as 
        txt[index of file].

    below, the first text buffer (numbers
    starting at zero) is reversed.
        txt[0].reverse()
        
    you can also upload multiple files using
    the chooser at the top of the page.
    (note: your existing buffers will be
    overwritten)


    selector
    -----------------------------------------
    after loading your files you can view
    them individually by clicking on the
    numbers that appear in the middle of 
    the page.
    
    the text can be retrieved using
    this number

/*
    decimate(amount, substitute = '-')
    -----------------------------------------
    you can decimate a string, replacing a 
    percentage of the text with the 
    substitution.

    by default it decimates individual
    characters, but soon it will allow for 
    decimating words instead.
*/

    filterRepeat(invert = false)
    -----------------------------------------
    you can filter out all repeat occurrences 
    of words.
    
    this function can also be inverted so 
    that only the repeats will be displayed.

    superimpose(txt2, delineate = ' ')

    non-whitespace characters of the first 
    document with the second.
*/

"lay two texts on top of each other".superimpose("THE TEXT ON TOP").out()

/*
    interleave(txt2, amount = 1.0, words = true)
    -----------------------------------------
    interleave will output a string that 
    alternates the characters(or words) 
    between two texts. If a second argument 
    is provided, it will alternate between 
    the texts at the given percentage.

    reverse(words = true)

    reverse individual characters instead.

    alphabetize(words = true)

    that accepts 'alpha' or 'length', etc?

    random(arr = txt)
    -----------------------------------------
    the random command can be used to select 
    a random element from an array.

    this means you can select texts at random
        random(txt).decimate(0.2)

    or use it to generate a random number
