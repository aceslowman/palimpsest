    palimpsest is a text manipulation toolkit


    basic concepts
    -----------------------------------------
    any piece of text (referred to as a 
    string) can have a number of methods 
    applied to it.

    every change you make to the text and
    each method applied to it will update
    on the opposite side of the screen.

    you can also execute the code by typing
    (windows, linux) ctrl-enter
        or
    (mac) cmd-enter

/*

    chaining
    -----------------------------------------
    any command can be chained together and 
    will only be output if ended with out().

    these chains can span multiple lines,
    making the document easier to read and
    experiment with.

    file input
    -----------------------------------------
    this tool can also handle multiple file 
    uploads by using the file chooser at the 
    top of the page.
    
    each text file will be loaded into an 
    array, accessible here as 
        txt[index of file].

    below, the first uploaded file (numbers
    starting at zero) is reversed.
        txt[0].reverse()


    selector
    -----------------------------------------
    after loading your files you can view
    them individually by clicking on the
    numbers that appear in the middle of 
    the page.
    
    the text can be retrieved using
    this number

// ABOUT THE METHODS

/*
    decimate(amount, substitute = '-')
    -----------------------------------------
    you can decimate a string, replacing a 
    percentage of the text with the 
    substitution.

    by default it decimates individual
    characters, but soon it will allow for 
    decimating words instead.
*/

"".decimate(0.2, '-').out()

/*
    filterRepeat(invert = false)
    -----------------------------------------
    you can filter out all repeat occurrences 
    of words.
    
    this function can also be inverted so 
    that only the repeats will be displayed.
*/

"".filterRepeat().out()

"".filterRepeat(true).out()

/*
    superimpose(txt2, delineate = ' ')
    -----------------------------------------
    superimpose will replace all 
    non-whitespace characters of the first 
    document with the second.
*/

"".superimpose("HELLO WORLD").out()

/*
    interleave(txt2, amount = 1.0, words = false)
    -----------------------------------------
    interleave will output a string that 
    alternates the characters(or words) 
    between two texts. If a second argument 
    is provided, it will alternate between 
    the texts at the given percentage.
*/

"".out()

/*
    reverse(words = true)
    -----------------------------------------
    reverse will reverse the order of the 
    words in a string.

    by passing false as an argument, it will
    reverse individual characters instead.
*/
"".reverse().out()
"".reverse(false).out()

/*
    random(arr = txt)
    -----------------------------------------
    the random command can be used to select 
    a random element from an array.

    this means you can select texts at random
        random(txt).decimate(0.2)

    or use it to generate a random number
        txt[0].decimate(random([0.0,0.5]))

    if no arguments are passed, it will get 
    the txt array by default.
*/
"".out();

/* for example
random(txt)
    .reverse(true)
    .interleave(random(txt), , true)
    .out()
