/*
    PALIMPSEST is a text manipulation toolkit


    basic concepts
    -----------------------------------------
    any piece of text (referred to as a 
    string) can have a number of methods 
    applied to it.

    every change you make to the text and
    each method applied to it will update
    on the opposite side of the screen.

    you can also execute the code by typing
    (windows, linux) ctrl-enter
        or
    (mac) cmd-enter
